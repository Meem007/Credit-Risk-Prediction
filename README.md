# Credit Risk Prediction

This project focuses on credit risk prediction, which is the assessment of the likelihood that a borrower will default on their financial obligations. It involves the use of machine learning models to analyze various factors and predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default or not.

## Introduction
Credit risk is a critical concern for financial institutions and lenders, as it directly impacts their profitability and stability. To mitigate this risk, many organizations rely on technology and data analysis to identify potential defaulters. In this project, we explore different machine learning models to predict credit risk.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains various features related to loan applicants, including age, income, employment length, credit history length, loan amount, loan interest rate, home ownership status, loan intent, loan grade, and more.

## Project Steps

### 1. Read the Dataset
We begin by reading the dataset using Python and libraries such as Pandas.

### 2. Data Visualization
We visualize the dataset to gain insights into its distribution and relationships between different features. This helps us understand the characteristics of each column and identify any potential patterns or trends.

### 3. Missing Value Detection
We check for missing values in the dataset and visualize columns with missing data. This step is crucial for identifying columns that may require data imputation or handling of missing values.

### 4. Convert Columns into Numerical Values
To prepare the data for machine learning models, we convert categorical columns into numerical values. This conversion enables machine learning algorithms to process the data effectively.

### 5. Handle Missing Values
We use the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation technique to fill in missing values in specific columns, ensuring that the dataset is complete and ready for modeling.

### 6. Data Splitting
We split the dataset into training and testing datasets, allowing us to train machine learning models on one portion of the data and evaluate their performance on another.

### 7. Build a Logistic Regression Model
We train a logistic regression model to predict credit risk. We evaluate the model's performance by calculating accuracy, creating a confusion matrix, and generating a classification report.

### 8. Build a Random Forest Model
We build a random forest classifier to predict credit risk. Similar to the logistic regression model, we evaluate its performance using accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report.

### 9. Build an XGBoost Model
We also create an XGBoost classifier model for credit risk prediction. We assess its accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to evaluate its performance.

### 10. Model Comparison
We compare the performance of the three models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) and discuss which model is the most suitable for credit risk prediction based on their respective strengths and weaknesses.

## Conclusion
Credit risk prediction is a critical task for financial institutions, and machine learning models can play a significant role in improving accuracy and efficiency in this domain. By comparing different models and their performance, we can make informed decisions about which model to deploy for credit risk assessment.
